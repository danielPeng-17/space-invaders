# space-invaders

This space invader game is written in python 3 and requires the pygame library to function correctly. 

If you do not have python, you can install it from the official python website which can be found here -> https://www.python.org/downloads/
And if you do not have pygame, you can install it from here -> https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

It's just a fun little project that I wrote a while ago but forgot to upload it until now. Feel free to try it out. Game instructions are on the home screen of the game.
